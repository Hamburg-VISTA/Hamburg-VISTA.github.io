The VISOR initiative is designed to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration in AI research across Hamburg by fostering partnerships between PIs, enabling innovative projects, and preparing for major grant applications. This event will be a valuable platform to learn more about VISOR, the current call for projects, and how to get involved.

Prof. Luisa Lucie-Smith of UHH and Dr. Sebastian Götschel of TUHH will offer exciting insights into their research on ML in physics. Following the talks, PIs will have an opportunity to meet and network over lunch and learn how they can team up with other PIs to apply for the opportunities VISOR has to offer.

Participation (including lunch) is free, but registration is required. <strong>Registration deadline for in-person attendance: February 20</strong>. Remote (zoom-only) registration will be possible until the end of the event.

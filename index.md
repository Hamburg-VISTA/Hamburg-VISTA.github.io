# Welcome to Hamburg VISTA!

The Hamburg metropolitan region is witnessing a surge in research activities at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in natural sciences and engineering. With notable clusters of excellence in physics and climate science, Hamburg has emerged as a leader in developing and applying AI techniques. 

Hamburg Virtual Initiative for Science & Technology in AI (Hamburg VISTA) aims to bridge the gap between research efforts, unlocking the full potential of AI in Hamburg's academic landscape. At the heart of Hamburg VISTA lies a commitment to enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration and tapping into latent synergies. To this end, Hamburg VISTA will create a cohort of Ph.D. students, jointly supervised by two VISTA researchers. These students, affiliated with partner institutions through their primary supervisors, symbolize our commitment to fostering interdisciplinary research and education, while also exploring new avenues for collaboration.

VISTA complements the ecosystem of <a href="https://www.dashh.org/" target="_blank">DASHH</a>, <a href="https://www.cdcs.uni-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">CDCS</a>, <a href="https://www.hcds.uni-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">HCDS</a>, and <a href="https://datascience-hamburg.org/" target="_blank">KIEZ</a> by connecting researchers across different insitutions in the Hamburg metropolitan region focusing on leading AI research and applications.

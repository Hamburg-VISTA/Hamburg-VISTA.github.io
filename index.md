# Welcome to Hamburg VISTA!

The Hamburg metropolitan region is witnessing a surge in research activities at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in natural sciences and engineering. With notable clusters of excellence in physics and climate science, Hamburg has emerged as a leader in developing and applying AI techniques. 

Hamburg Virtual Initiative for Science & Technology in AI (Hamburg VISTA) aims to bridge the gap between research efforts, unlocking the full potential of AI in Hamburg's academic landscape. At the heart of Hamburg VISTA lies a commitment to enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration and tapping into latent synergies. 

Associated to VISTA is the VISOR graduate school. VISOR will provide co-funding for establishing a cohort of PhD students, working on cutting-edge AI topics in the natural sciences and engineering, jointly supervised by VISTA <a href="/people.html">PIs</a> from different institutions. The VISOR initiative is designed to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration in AI research across Hamburg by fostering partnerships between PIs, enabling innovative projects, and preparing for major grant applications, such as DFG TRR or SFB with integrated graduate schools. 

The goal of VISTA/VISOR is not just to advance AI research; but to create a vibrant, connected research ecosystem that will make Hamburg a leading city for applied AI research. 

VISTA is part of the collaborative topic "Computing and Data Science" in the <a href="https://www.pier-plus.de/en/zusammenarbeit.html" target="_blank">PIER PLUS</a> Partnership for Innovation, Eduation and Research in the metropolitan region of Hamburg, and complements the ecosystem of <a href="https://www.dashh.org/" target="_blank">DASHH</a>, <a href="https://www.cdcs.uni-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">CDCS</a>, <a href="https://www.hcds.uni-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">HCDS</a>, and <a href="https://datascience-hamburg.org/" target="_blank">KIEZ</a> by connecting researchers across different institutions in this region focusing on leading AI research and applications.

intro: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models trained on large datasets, capable of being finetuned to different tasks. This project builds on the first cross-task foundation model for jet physics, OmniJet-α, which was developed by the Kasieczka group at UHH inspired by the GPT architecture. While the original model only used tokenized input of a limited set of features, this project will expand this to also include continuous features and a broader feature set. The project will also explore other pretraining strategies besides pure next token prediction. It is expected that this will improve the classification performance of the model.

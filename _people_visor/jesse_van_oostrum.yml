intro: "This project aims to advance how artificial intelligence helps us understand the Universe. It focuses on improving a powerful type of machine-learning model called a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns to represent complex data in a simplified, interpretable form. While VAEs have been widely used in image and language processing, applying them to astrophysics presents a key challenge: ensuring that the model’s internal representations—its \"latent space\"—can be meaningfully linked to real physical quantities such as those describing galaxies or cosmic structures. The research will develop an enhanced version of the beta-VAE by modifying its loss function to prevent posterior collapse, a problem that causes models to lose important information. By overcoming this limitation, the project aims to extract interpretable and explainable physical insights from astronomical data. Building on the candidate's PhD research in information geometry and generative modelling, and in collaboration with Prof. Luisa Lucie-Smith, this work will bridge machine learning and astrophysics—opening new pathways for AI-driven scientific discovery across multiple fields."

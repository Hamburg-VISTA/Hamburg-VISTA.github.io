intro: "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) measures strain or strain rate along an optical fiber with a high spatial and temporal resolution. The typical channel distance is in the order of a few meters while the sampling frequency can reach 1 kHz or higher, which makes it possible to record a wide range of seismic signals. The fibers used for DAS can be several kilometers long and measurements take place over days, weeks or months, resulting in very large datasets of up to several terabytes per day. This large amount of data, makes it challenging to get an overview of the different types of seismic signals present in the data, since a manual inspection can become immensely time-consuming. A good knowledge of occurring seismic signals is important for the removal of seismic noise in high precision measurements like gravitational wave detection or for geophysical applications like surface wave inversion where the usage of specific seismic signals is desired. The aim of this project is to automatically detect and categorize different types of seismic signals by clustering large DAS datasets. This work takes place within the WAVE initiative which investigates a seismic measurement network at and around the Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld to support research in physics and geophysics."
